# Contribute to an existing project
{:.no_toc}

A project can contain one or more books, such as a series or collection. It will be stored on GitHub as a single repository.

When you contribute to an existing project, you create your own version of it to work in. That is, you copy a parent project. Then, from time to time, you can choose to submit your changes to that parent.

> To create a new project, see [Create a new project](../create-new-project).

Before you make your copy, you need to have ready:

* the GitHub username of the owner (an organisation or an individual, e.g. `electricbookworks`)
* the GitHub name of the project repository (e.g. `superpotatoes`) you want to contribute to.

Together, those two things make up the GitHub identity of the project, e.g. `electricbookworks/superpotatoes`.

1. Once signed in, from the dashboard click:
   
    - 'Add a project'
    - 'Contribute to an existing project.'
    - 'Next'.

1. Enter the GitHub owner and repo for the project you will contribute to. e.g `electricbookworks/superpotatoes`. Then click 'Copy project'.

It may take a few minutes for the Electric Book Manager to set up your project for you, ready for adding content. 

> Technical note: Contributing to an existing project creates a fork of the parent repository in your account on GitHub.
