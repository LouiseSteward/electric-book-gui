# How to sign in

To sign in, the EBM's support team will have to give you access first. Once that's done:

1. Go to the URL of your Electric Book Manager. For example, the hosted EBM maintained by [Electric Book Works](https://electricbookworks.com) is at [manage.electricbook.works](http://manage.electricbook.works).
2. Click 'Sign in with GitHub'. If you donâ€™t have a GitHub account, you will be prompted to sign up for a free account. If you already have an account, sign into your GitHub account to give the EBM permission to connect to your account.
