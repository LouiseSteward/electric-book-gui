## Print PDF

A print PDF is the file you would send to a professional book printer.

1. From the editing page, click ‘Output’ and then choose ‘Print PDF’.
2. Choose which book you would like to output, by its folder. This is often the `book` folder, or whatever the `book` folder has been renamed to.
3. You should see a ‘Printing in progress…’ bar on the bottom right of the editing page. Your print PDF will open in a new tab in your browser. For large, complex books this can take a few minutes. (If a new tab doesn't open, make sure your browser isn't blocking popups).

> Currently, PDFs have a Prince watermark on its first page, since you’re using a trial version of Prince. Contact Electric Book Works ([team@electricbookworks.com](mailto:team@electricbookworks.com)) about getting a print-ready PDF without a watermark.

## Screen PDF

A screen PDF is a page-based version of your book for reading on screen. It is sometimes called a PDF ebook.

1. From the editing page, click ‘Output’ and then choose ‘Screen PDF’.
2. Choose which folder you would like to output, for your book this would usually be the ‘book’ folder, or whatever the ‘book’ folder has been renamed to.
3. You should see a ‘Printing in progress…’ bar on the bottom right of the editing page. Your screen PDF will open in a new tab in your browser. (If a new tab doesn't open, make sure your browser isn't blocking popups).

## Website

The EBM will generate a working website version of your book for you to review.

1. From the editing page, click ‘Output’ and then choose ‘Web version’. This will open a new tab in your browser and display ‘Building in progress… autoreloading…’. You will also see the console running, converting your work into a working website. (If a new tab doesn't open, make sure your browser isn't blocking popups.)
2. Once the website is ready, that tab will autoreload and open to your book’s project homepage. (You can change this homepage by editing the ‘index.md’ file.)

To create website code ready for putting on a live server, you will need a technically skilled person to build the project for you on their computer. Contact [Electric Book Works](https://electricbookworks) if you need professional guidance.
