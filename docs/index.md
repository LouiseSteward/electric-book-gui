# The Electric Book Manager

The Electric Book Manager makes it easier for non-technical editors to use the [Electric Book Workflow](https://electricbookworks.github.io/electric-book/) online, without installing anything on their own computers.

Using the EBM, each user's books are stored in the cloud in GitHub repositories. Each repository uses the Electric Book template, an open-source tool for creating books and book-like websites.

These docs are about using the Electric Book Manager only. If you need to know how to use the Electric Book workflow, including guidance on creating and editing books in markdown, see [the workflow docs](https://electricbookworks.github.io/electric-book/docs/).

> This documentation is a work in progress. You can help by [logging issues on GitHub](http://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book-gui/issues).
